## New dedicated server

When getting started working with the panel, you should add a dedicated server (VDS/VPS, container, physical server) to run GameAP Daemon.

You can install GameAP Daemon on a dedicated server automatically by executing a script, or you can do it manually. When installing manually, you should also generate SSL certificates and sign them, as well as edit the configuration file `/etc/gameap-daemon/gameap-daemon.cfg`.

### Automatic GameAP Daemon installation on a dedicated server

Go to the "Administration" -> "Dedicated Servers" page, click on the "Create" button.
A window appears prompting you to automatically install GameAP Daemon on a dedicated server. Copy the command and run it on the dedicated server as the superuser. The command looks something like this:
```
curl http://your-panel/gdaemon/setup/zItWHWlI4RKPl9ZsYc3y3Wgd | bash --
```
The command will be available for execution within 5 minutes. After the time elapses, reload the page to see the new command.

## Editing dedicated servers

To edit a dedicated server (node), go to **"Administration"** -> **"Dedicated Servers"** page, then 
select the dedicated server you want to edit and click on the **"Edit"** button.

### Description of parameters

of the working directory contain the files of game servers. For the specified path, 
[game server directory](/en/gameap_configure/game_servers.html#directory) is assigned. The default is `/srv/gameap`.

#### GameAP Daemon

Parameters for connecting GameAP Daemon to the server. The panel interacts with a dedicated server through GameAP Daemon 
(GDaemon). GameAP Daemon is a multi-component server with a service that monitors gaming
servers, launches them as needed and executes the necessary commands on them.

These are important settings. If something is specified incorrectly, work with game servers will most likely be impossible.

extra security. Fields are optional and are empty by default.
