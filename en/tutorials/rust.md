Rust is a survival game developed by Facepunch Studios. 
Players need to gather resources, craft items, 
and build shelters to survive in a hostile open-world environment.

Rust is somewhat similar to [Minecraft](/en/tutorials/minecraft.html) 
with its survival system and item crafting.

## Environment Setup

GameAP provides full support for Rust game servers, including player management. 
Installing the panel will take a little time; choose one of the following 
control panel installation options:

* [Installing GameAP on Linux](/en/install/install_on_linux.html)
* [Installing GameAP on Windows](/en/install/install_on_windows.html)

### Installing GameAP Daemon

To install the game server on a machine (VDS), 
you need to install GameAP Daemon. 
During the GameAP installation, you can choose to install it fully, 
including Daemon.

In the control panel, go to **"Administration"** -> **"Dedicated Servers"** 
-> **"Create"**. 
A window with an offer for automatic installation will appear. 
Copy the code and execute it on the dedicated server.

After this, you can proceed to install the Rust server.
